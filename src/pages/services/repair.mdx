With our passion fully aligned with getting the details right, FoxTrot Aviation has always been well
positioned for any space which emphasizes precision and appearance. In 2019, the opportunity arose
for FoxTrot to acquire an experienced shop, and the interior team was off and running. FoxTrot went
the extra mile and obtained our Part 145 Repair Station Certificate (FT2R835D) to be most flexible and
helpful to our customers.

Our deeply rooted partnerships allow our team to flexibly accommodate your aircraft or fleet’s busy
schedule. Our team is passionate about transparency in the refurbishment process. FoxTrot will bring
proactive communication to the forefront to ensure owners get the look and result they desire.

FoxTrot has many routes to achieving optimal appearance, from a new, bespoke solution all the way
down to a re dye of the seating, polishing existing woodwork, and deep cleaning of carpeting. No
matter what the budget, FoxTrot will have an option available that best fits any principle’s needs and
budget. Why be shoehorned into the wrong option when FoxTrot can develop a custom solution for
you?
