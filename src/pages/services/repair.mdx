With our passion fully aligned with getting the details right, FoxTrot Aviation has always been well
positioned for any space which emphasizes precision and appearance. In 2019, the opportunity arose
for FoxTrot to acquire an experienced shop, and the interior team was off and running. FoxTrot went
the extra mile and obtained our Part 145 Repair Station Certificate (FT2R835D) to be most flexible and
helpful to our customers.
