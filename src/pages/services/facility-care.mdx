Facilities are more than just buildings for those who work in or pass through them every day. For some,
they are much closer to second homes and deserve a cleaning service that reflects this importance. An
FBO can often be a touch point for a VIP which could drive thousands of gallons per month in fuel sales.
In this critical, competitive environment, choosing the right partners is more vital than ever before.

- Aviation specific training â€“ the support staff you receive is aware of the unique discretion and
  hazards that are common occurrences in an aviation environment
- Our proprietary staffing model means a quick solution for your cleaning needs
- We take the administrative complexity, management time, and turnover out of your day to day
  tasks and lets your team focus on its core competency
- Unlike much larger facility cleaning competitors, FoxTrot has built in readiness to badge
  employees in order to access facilities inside the AOA or SIDA
- Responsive managers and leaderships means if there is an issue, corrections can be made in real
  time. FoxTrot always works to make things right and improve.

No task is too big or small. FoxTrot Facility Cleaners have what it takes no matter what the scope is. Do
you have a special event coming to your hangar? We can help with porters during the event or simply
clean up afterward. Our teams can come in monthly to detail facilities in conjunction with in house
staff, or FoxTrot can craft a completely hands off solution for your team. FoxTrot has improved the
ongoing appearance of several nationally branded FBOs as well as individual businesses, and we would
love to bring the same level of attention to your facility.
