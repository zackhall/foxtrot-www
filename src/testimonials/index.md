      We have been using FoxTrot for over 5 years and I would highly recommend their services
      for any of your aircraft detailing needs. FoxTrot's team is an ideal partner for my
      in-house cleaning staff, they are always prompt, in uniform, and ready to work. Some
      of our jets have 10+ year old paint and interior, with their help the fleet looks better than ever.

      I look forward to an ongoing relationship with this great company.

      In the day to day of managing a Part 135 charter operation, cost and quality results go hand and hand when determining our refurbishment choices.  During our most recent project, recovering the seats simply wasn’t in the budget, so we reached out to FoxTrot to perform a redying for us.  The work was completed on time, affordable, and left a wonderful impression on our owners.  I would recommend their team’s work to anyone.

      	After working as an Assistant Crew Chief for 5 months, I have proven to management that I have the skills and dedication for an opening as a Crew Chief in Charlotte, North Carolina.

      I have had a great experience working for Foxtrot. I originally applied just looking to get my foot back into the aviation field but with my hard work and dedication I quickly started moving up in the company. Foxtrot has been a pleasure to work for and I am happy to be apart of a company that is continuing to grow and make such a positive impact in this industry.

      Foxtrot is the most unique company I’ve ever worked for; from working around my chaotic university schedule to traveling to new cities I’ve never visited. I started out brand new to the aviation industry and I have grown and matured in innumerable ways in terms of my personal and professional development during my time at Foxtrot. I get excited to come work with a great team of people every day, I’ve had long days with a lot of hard work, but I’ve yet to have a bad day at Foxtrot.

      After three years of working at Foxtrot, my opinion has always been that it is a great place to work at. Aviation in general is an amazing field to be in. Specifically working on private aircraft, is also a way to elevate oneself to a level that is only normally attainable by the elite. Every day can lead to new adventures, while working in your home city. As well as traveling throughout the United States. Hopefully we’re able to continue growing as a company exponentially. Leading to worldwide opportunities.
