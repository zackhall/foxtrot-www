      We have been using FoxTrot for over 5 years and I would highly recommend their services
      for any of your aircraft detailing needs. FoxTrot's team is an ideal partner for my
      in-house cleaning staff, they are always prompt, in uniform, and ready to work. Some
      of our jets have 10+ year old paint and interior, with their help the fleet looks better than ever.

      I look forward to an ongoing relationship with this great company.

      In the day to day of managing a Part 135 charter operation, cost and quality results go hand and hand when determining our refurbishment choices.  During our most recent project, recovering the seats simply wasn’t in the budget, so we reached out to FoxTrot to perform a redying for us.  The work was completed on time, affordable, and left a wonderful impression on our owners.  I would recommend their team’s work to anyone.

      	After working as an Assistant Crew Chief for 5 months, I have proven
        management that I have the skills and dedication for an opening as a Crew Chief in Charlotte, North Carolina. I
        was offered the position and I enjoy each day I come into work, knowing that I have goals to meet (budget,
        client’s satisfaction, and employees) on daily, weekly, and monthly basis.

      While managing our Columbus location I hold positions on the Safety
      Committee and Training Committee which allows me to share my experiences with new employees and travel to our various locations to help
      new Crew Chiefs feel comfortable in their new role.  I plan to continue to grow with FoxTrot as we work towards our mission to be
      the best aircraft detailing company in the United States.
